This product is a replica of an original [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/20540597/) design.
I only use the design to get a road map of some design to follow while building this project for my front end developer practise sessions so I could showcase my experience in my developer portfolio

## What This Project is all about

This project is to showcase how to turn an online design into a fully functional front end site.
